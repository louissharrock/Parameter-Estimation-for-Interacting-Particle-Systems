# Parameter Estimation for Interacting Particle Systems

This respository contains code for performing parameter estimation in interacting particle systems. The code currently provides the following functionality:

* Offline Parameter Estimation
  * (Penalised) Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Mean Field Models.
  * (Penalised) Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Interacting Particle Systems with non-linear drifts, linear interactions, and additive noise.
  
* Online Parameter Estimation
  * Recursive Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Mean Field Models, using stochastic gradient descent in continuous time (SGDCT).
  * Recursive Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Interacting Particle Systems with non-linear drifts, linear interactions, and additive noise, using stochastic gradient descent in continuous time (SGDCT).
